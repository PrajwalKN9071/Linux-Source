1.linux is a case sensitive OS(recomment you to always use lower case)

2.CentOS: is a commmunity enterprise os(Greg kurtzer invented in 2004 and took code from redhat)
and redhat acquired cemtos in 2014 and it is upstream

3.Snapshot:allows u to save consent of the vm
make sure it is in poweroff state and go to snapshot give a name and give okay after that if you go ahead and make some changes and did some mistakes and u want to restore it again to the same state go to snapshot and select snapshot and click on restore 

4.virtual machine management:

5. Bridged Adapter:its gone a take ip address from the own compute and it will gonna communicate with outside world
   Host-only adapter--> allows communication between ur pc and the vm

6. Linux:                               
    free                                   
    not user frdly  
    very reliable often runs for months or years
    mostly enterprise levele softwares
    best for multi-tasking
    very secure
    open to public
   
   Windows:
     $$$
     User frdly
     often requires reboot
     much larger selection of software 
     multi tasking is available but with very high cpu or memory resources
     some what secure
     no an open source OS

7. Linux users:
*US Gov and Agencies
*NASA
*Health care
*Bullet train 
*Traffic control
*Finance institute
*Entertainment industries
*World e-commerce leaders runs there application runs on linux


8.Keyboard keys in Linux:
Esc : to escape for previous pressed key
~ (tilda) :to go to home directory
! :to refered to as bank
@ : to refer anyone
# : to comment out and just for information purpose
$ : variable
^ : to go to beggining of the task
& : to put something in the background

>> : appending to the file
> :overide a file
/ : forward slash
right ctrl : in linux if your mouse curson stuck somewhere press to diable that



9.Commands prompts in Linux:
It is a short text at the start of the command line, followed by prompt symbol
                      
[root@MyFirstLinuxVM-]#:
root:username
MyFirstLinuxVM:hostname
#:Prompt symbol

login as root means that this is the default user o we can access every key which is available in linux

10. Access to linux system:
 Each os has a different protocol or client tat is used to access the system 
examples:
windows : Remote desktop(RDP)
VMware ESX : vSphere client
Linux : Putty, SecureCRT,ssh from linux  to linux

11. Import things to remember in Linux:
* Linux has super-user account called root and that is the most powerfull a count that can create, modify, delete accounts and make changes to system config files
* linus is case sensitive
* avoid using spaces when creATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES
* Linux kernel is not an os its a small software within linux os that takes commands from users and pass them to system hardware or peropherals
* Linux is cli not a gui
* linus is very flexible comapred to other os

12. Linux File System:
OS store data on disk drives in a structure of filesystem its consisting of files, directories, and info needed to access and locate them
ex:ext3,ext4,XFS etc


13. File system structure and its description: divided into different directory
/boot : contains file used for boot loader
/root : its a root username directory
/dev : system devices like disk,speaker,flasdrive
/etc : configuration files which come from linux
/bin or /usr/bin : everyday user commands
/sbin or /usr/sbin : syatem/filesystem commands
/opt : optional add-on application (other application except default are there in this file)
/proc : running processes ( only exist im memory)
/lib or usr/lib : c programming library files needed by commands and apps                                                                     
/tmp : temp files
/home : directory for user
/var : system logs
/run : system daemon thats starts very early to store tempp runtime files like pid files
/mnt :  to mount external filesystem
/media : for cdrom mounts
 


14. Navigating file system:
when navigating a unix filesystem there are a few important commands
cd: change directory
pwd:print working directory
ls : list directory
clear : to clear the screen
su - : to switch user to root
cd / : to go to main starting / directory
cd .. : one step back


15. what is root?
3 types of roots in linux
* root account
* root as
* root home directory

15. Path:
* Absolute path:
An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/).
* Realtive path:
Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd). It starts at your current directory and never starts with a / .


16. 
* any files starts with "d" its directory
* any files starts with "l" its a link
* any files starts with "-" its a regular files


17. Create files and directories:
* creating files:
1.touch <filename>
2.cp <copying_filename> <destination file name> : copy existing file and create new
3.vi
* creating directories
1.mkdir

18. Copy of directories:
cp -R <source_folder> </destination_folder>

19. linux file types:
-  : regular file
d  : directory
l  : link
c  : specific file or device file
s  : socket
p : named pipe
b  : block device

20. Find files and directories:
Two main commands are used to find files/directories

*find : To find the files which is available in any director
we could use this command : find . -name "filename"
example:find . -name "kramer"

*locate : if locate command does not output any result, then as root run "updatedb"
also make sure you have "mlocate" package installed
to check+ rpm -qa | grep mlocate
to install = yum install mlocate


21. difference b/w find and locate
* locate uses a prebuild db, which should be regularly updated, while find iterates over a filesystem to locate files.thus locate is much faster than find
but can be inaccurate if the db is not updated
* to update local database run "updatedb" command


22. changing password:
command = passwd userid
it will ask old password
ask you new password
recomform new password


23. wildcards:
a wildcard is a character that can be used in a substitute for
any of a class of characters in a search

* - represents zero or more character
? - represents a single character
[] - represents a range of character
 other wildcards:
\ : as an escape character
^ : the beginning of the line
$ : the end of the line

24. to create 9 files:
touch abcd{1..9}-xyz

25. inode : pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
to list inode command : ls -li
 
command : ln -s
soft link : link will be removed if file is removed or renamed

command : ln 
hard link : deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link.

Note : you cant  create soft or hard link within the same directory with the same name. that is why
we will create linksin /temp directory


26. File permission:
there are 3 types of permission
r - read
w - write
x - execute = running a program

permission can be controlled at three levels:
u - user=yourself
g - group=can be people in the same project
o - other-everyone on the system

file or directory permission can be displayed by running by running this command
ls -l

command to change permission
command : chmod
