1.linux is a case sensitive OS(recomment you to always use lower case)

2.CentOS: is a commmunity enterprise os(Greg kurtzer invented in 2004 and took code from redhat)
and redhat acquired cemtos in 2014 and it is upstream

3.Snapshot:allows u to save consent of the vm
make sure it is in poweroff state and go to snapshot give a name and give okay after that if you go ahead and make some changes and did some mistakes and u want to restore it again to the same state go to snapshot and select snapshot and click on restore 

4.virtual machine management:

5. Bridged Adapter:its gone a take ip address from the own compute and it will gonna communicate with outside world
   Host-only adapter--> allows communication between ur pc and the vm

6. Linux:                               
    free                                   
    not user frdly  
    very reliable often runs for months or years
    mostly enterprise levele softwares
    best for multi-tasking
    very secure
    open to public
   
   Windows:
     $$$
     User frdly
     often requires reboot
     much larger selection of software 
     multi tasking is available but with very high cpu or memory resources
     some what secure
     no an open source OS

9.Commands prompts in Linux:
It is a short text at the start of the command line, followed by prompt symbol
                      
[root@MyFirstLinuxVM-]#:
root:username
MyFirstLinuxVM:hostname
#:Prompt symbol

login as root means that this is the default user o we can access every key which is available in linux

10. Access to linux system:
 Each os has a different protocol or client tat is used to access the system 
examples:
windows : Remote desktop(RDP)
VMware ESX : vSphere client
Linux : Putty, SecureCRT,ssh from linux  to linux

11. Import things to remember in Linux:
* Linux has super-user account called root and that is the most powerfull a count that can create, modify, delete accounts and make changes to system config files
* linus is case sensitive
* avoid using spaces when creATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES
* Linux kernel is not an os its a small software within linux os that takes commands from users and pass them to system hardware or peropherals
* Linux is cli not a gui
* linus is very flexible comapred to other os

12. Linux File System:
OS store data on disk drives in a structure of filesystem its consisting of files, directories, and info needed to access and locate them
ex:ext3,ext4,XFS etc


13. File system structure and its description: divided into different directory
/boot : contains file used for boot loader
/root : its a root username directory
/dev : system devices like disk,speaker,flasdrive
/etc : configuration files which come from linux
/bin or /usr/bin : everyday user commands
/sbin or /usr/sbin : syatem/filesystem commands
/opt : optional add-on application (other application except default are there in this file)
/proc : running processes ( only exist im memory)
/lib or usr/lib : c programming library files needed by commands and apps                                                                     
/tmp : temp files
/home : directory for user
/var : system logs
/run : system daemon thats starts very early to store tempp runtime files like pid files
/mnt :  to mount external filesystem
/media : for cdrom mounts
 


14. Navigating file system:
when navigating a unix filesystem there are a few important commands
cd: change directory
pwd:print working directory
ls : list directory
clear : to clear the screen
su - : to switch user
cd / : to go to main starting / directory
cd .. : one step back

* Realtive path:
Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd). It starts at your current directory and never starts with a / .


16. 
* any files starts with "d" its directory
* any files starts with "l" its a link
